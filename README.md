# DeepLX Serverless

A free-to-deploy translation API, compatible with [OwO-Network/DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX), built with serverless platforms to avoid frequent request issues such as HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`.

> [!TIP]
> For better security and to prevent misuse, it’s strongly recommended to configure a `token`.
> Multiple tokens can be set using commas (`,`).
