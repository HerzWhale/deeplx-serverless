> [!TIP]
> Since `netlify functions` requires that all requests must be for `/.netlify/functions`, to access the api correctly you have to request this path `/.netlify/functions/translate`.
>
> If you find that netlify deployment fails, you can try modifying the contents of the `README.md` file for the current repository. For example, you can add a new space or just type whatever you want, then commit your changes, and netlify will automatically detect your changes and redeploy automatically!
